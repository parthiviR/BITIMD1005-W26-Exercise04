# Exercise 11 - Responsive Design

Build a responsive landing page using mobile-first approach.

## Steps

1. Create a new folder and open it in VSCode
2. Copy `index.html` and `style.css` from this repository
3. Work through Tasks 1-9 in the files
4. Test by resizing your browser window
5. Use DevTools device mode (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) to test specific sizes

## Testing Tips

- Start narrow (mobile), then drag wider to see breakpoints kick in
- Check at 320px, 768px, and 1024px specifically
- Test both portrait and landscape on tablet sizes
- Make sure nothing overflows or breaks at any width

## Breakpoints Used

| Breakpoint | Target |
|------------|--------|
| Base (no query) | Mobile phones |
| 768px | Tablets and up |
| 1024px | Desktops and up |
